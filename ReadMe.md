# DiceRoller

## Summary

Dice Roller is my first project as a self-taught developer/programmer. It came about as a way to try an reinforce the concepts of Javascript and Web Dev tech that I had been learning.
As someone who enjoys TTRPG's, I thought about various other Dice Rolling apps and websites and I also thought about what I would want out of my own.
While what I want in the end is still quite a ways away, my main goal with this is to get the core functionality working.  \

## Phase 1

The first phase of the project is to make working versions of the following functionality:

- An array of buttons representing the standard TTRPG dice array (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20 and 100)
- A pair of buttons that, when toggled, will simulate rolling with advantage or disadvantage
- Allow the rolling of multiple dice with an input field.

These features will be accompanied by foundational HTML (maybe CSS) in order to present them in an intuitive manner, as well as present the individual results and sums as necessary on the webpage as opposed to on an alert.

## Phase 2

The second phase will be where I begin sourcing images and possibly small animations for the dice rolls.

I would also like to ensure that different types of dice can be rolled in combination (eg. 2x d4's and 3xd10's).
In another effort to beautify, I want to add images and fonts that add to the feel of the webpage.

Furthermore, I will be reaching out to close friends to help me test the functionality and take feedback to incorporate into further development.

## WIP

I do have a lot to learn, and my goal is, as I grow and learn more, I would like to include testing steps onto this document, as well as learn the proper ways to share this functionality.

This document will be updated as goals are realised, added and potentially shift.

Thank you in advance for reading and for any interest.
